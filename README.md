# Reactows 95

A set of React components for recreating everyone's favourite operating system as a webapp.

[Demo app here](https://reactows-95-demo.herokuapp.com/) (not guaranteed to be up-to-date).

To try it out using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/):

```
git clone https://github.com/Middlerun/reactows-95.git
cd reactows-95
yarn install
yarn storybook
```

## To do

- More window types
- State container for window management (currently being developed within the example app, but I'll probably move it into this library at some point)
- Documentation of components and their props
- Use TypeScript?
